# JavaScript RAG Web Apps with LlamaIndex

This repository documents the course **[JavaScript RAG Web Apps with LlamaIndex](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/javascript-rag-web-apps-with-llamaindex/)**, provided by **[DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)** in collaboration with **[LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/)**.

The course teaches how to build **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** web applications with **JavaScript**, integrating **LlamaIndex** for powerful querying and information retrieval.

## 📖 About the Course

Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but limited by the data they were trained on. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) bridges this gap by combining LLMs with external knowledge sources.

This course provides a **hands-on journey** into building **JavaScript RAG applications**, from setting up the basics to deploying production-ready systems.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

* Understand the **principles of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.
* Build a **full-stack web app** powered by LlamaIndex.
* Design and execute **advanced queries with agents**.
* Apply **production-ready techniques** for scalability and robustness.

---

## 📚 Course Topics

### 1️⃣ Getting Started with RAG

* Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
* Why RAG is important for extending LLM capabilities.
* Key components of a RAG pipeline (retrievers, indexes, and LLMs).
* Setting up **JavaScript + LlamaIndex** for your first RAG queries.

---

### 2️⃣ Build a Full-Stack Web App

* Creating a **front-end interface** for RAG-powered apps.
* Connecting a **Node.js/Express backend** with LlamaIndex.
* Managing context and prompts for user queries.
* Deploying your first **end-to-end RAG web application**.

---

### 3️⃣ Advanced Queries with Agents

* Understanding **agents** and their role in structured querying.
* Configuring LlamaIndex **query engines and tools**.
* Building **multi-step reasoning pipelines**.
* Handling **complex user queries** with dynamic workflows.

---

### 4️⃣ Production-Ready Techniques

* Scaling your RAG application for multiple users.
* Performance optimization (indexing strategies, caching).
* Error handling and fail-safes for robust deployments.
* Best practices for **monitoring, logging, and maintenance**.
